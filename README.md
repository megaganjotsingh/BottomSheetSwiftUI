  ### You can simply call bottom sheet in simple way

  ```swift
      BottomSheet(
        isShowingSheet: `Binding Variable that cotrols bottom sheet presentation and dismissal`,
        content: `Desired vew you want to present in Bottom Sheet`
      )

  ```

I tried to build an easy to use API, but I'm sure there are ways of improving and adding more features, If you think that we can do the ToggleSwitch more powerful please contribute with this project.
